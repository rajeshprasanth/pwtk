The Quantum Espresso Tools project provides a comprehensive suite of Python scripts aimed at enhancing the interoperability and functionality of computational materials science workflows. With a primary focus on facilitating the conversion and manipulation of atomic structure files between VASP POSCAR format and Quantum Espresso input/output file formats, this project streamlines the preprocessing and postprocessing stages of electronic structure calculations.

In addition to its core functionality, Quantum Espresso Tools offers advanced features such as the application of uniaxial strain to atomic structures, enabling researchers to simulate and analyze the mechanical response of materials under controlled deformation conditions. These tools cater to a wide range of users in the fields of condensed matter physics, materials science, and computational chemistry, providing them with efficient and flexible solutions for their electronic structure simulation needs.

By leveraging the capabilities of Python programming language and the ASE (Atomic Simulation Environment) library, Quantum Espresso Tools ensures ease of use, extensibility, and compatibility with existing computational materials science software ecosystems. Whether used as standalone utilities or integrated into larger simulation workflows, these tools empower researchers to explore and understand the properties of materials at the atomic level with greater precision and efficiency.
